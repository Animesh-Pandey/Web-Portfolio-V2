            I’m a learning developer passionate about creating engaging web
            experiences that combine thoughtful design with efficient
            programming. My favorite work lies in crafting engaging, responsive
            applications that not only function beautifully but are built with
            scalability and performance in mind.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I’m honing my skills in full-stack development while
            working on projects that range from interactive web apps to
            database-driven systems. I thrive on learning new tools and
            technologies, and I enjoy exploring the intersection of creativity
            and logic to bring ideas to life.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the past, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate on diverse
            projects, from crafting an item recommendation system to designing
            solutions for global sustainability through an international
            internship. These experiences have strengthened my adaptability,
            problem-solving, and ability to think outside the box.
            <br />

            In my free time, you'll mostly find me playing basketball, boxing,
            reading, or just standing in lines to get some bubble tea. Hahah!
